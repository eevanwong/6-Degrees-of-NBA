# Six Degrees of NBA

Six Degrees of NBA showcases that players are interconnected no matter what decade and team they play in, from Michael Jordan to Kyle Lowry to Lebron James. This project was inspired by Emily Louie's [Six Degrees of Spotify](https://github.com/emilyslouie/six-degrees) and Fanatics.com's [Social Network of the NBA](http://content.fanatics.com/six-degrees-nba/).

Data used for this site was all web scraped from basketball-reference.com using Puppeteer as of March 2021. Site was created with React, Express, and Neo4j.

This project will be hosted as I had already purchased a domain name for this (riperoni)

## Inspiration

The Six Degree's of Seperation was a super interesting concept to me. There were a multitude of different ways I could go about it. With basketball being a growing interest, I had thought how I could show connections between different NBA players and how it would be able to find connections between the most unlikely of players.

While I was researching this topic, I had come across fanatics.com's own version of this. However, they did not go in depth in how each of the players were connected, in regards to which year they played on in which team.

## Design
